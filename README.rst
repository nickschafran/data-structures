Data Structures
===============

This repository contains implementation of a few basic data structures in
Python 2.7. It exists for non-commercial, self-learning purposes. Tests are run 
using ``nose`` (See the Environment Setup section).

Some of the implementations draw from the book "Problem Solving with Algorithms
and Data Structures using Python" by Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum (Â©

I reccomend the book highly for those learning data structures. It can be read
in online form
